# Event Dashboard

## Academic project creating an event dashboard

Every action triggered by Twitter reloaded should be registered as a new event at the event dashboard.

The information that we need to save is:
- Type of action: create tweet / reply tweet / open application
- User who did the action
Timestamp
- With the event data stored create one or several reports, that answer this questions
- What is the user who registered more events during the day?
- What is the most commented tweet of the day?
- How many users opened our application during the day?
